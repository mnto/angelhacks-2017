# angelhacks-2017: Nosh

Created during the 2017 Silicon Valley Angelhacks on Saturday, July 29, 2017 - Sunday, July 30, 2017 

Project description: Food waste in America is a current pressing environmental issue because waste that could feed individuals in need often end up in landfill because restaurant and grocery stores throw away perfectly good food. Nosh is mobile app to allow local food providers (gardeners, restaurants, farmers, grocery stores, etc.) to sell their food surplus to consumers at discounted prices 

## Registration/Login

On each food provider's site, users can see what items have been posted, and the available quantity. They can claim an amount of each item. A confirmation will be sent to the user. The receipt contains a unique QR code that can be scanned when the user visits a local food provider to receive the produce that they have claimed.
